<p class='noindent'>   There are a large number of official and unofficial published scenarios. These scenarios can be used with <span class='ecti-1000'>BattleTech:
Outworlds Wastes </span>with the following conversion rules.
   
   </p>
   <h4 class='subsectionHead' id='general'><span class='titlemark'>6.1   </span> <a id='x7-370006.1'></a>General</h4>
 
<p class='indent'>In order to use a existing scenario with <span class='ecti-1000'>BattleTech: Outworlds Wastes</span>, force restrictions and allocation of payments should be
identified.
</p> 
<p class='noindent'>   Scenario forces should generally match the units available to commanders in the <a href='force-construction.html#_'>Force Construction</a> rules. For example, a
scenario that relies upon a squadron of aerospace fighters would require additional modifications as a commanderâ€™s DropShip
typically has a maximum of two aerospace bays.
</p> 
<p class='noindent'>   Rewards should generally match the guidelines found in the <a href='scenarios.html#scenario-scoring'>Scenario Scoring</a> rules. For scenarios with victory points,
Supply Points, Warchest Points, or other metrics of gradated success between commanders, award the primary objective
payment based upon the level of success of each side. For example, if one side earned 8 victory points and the other side
earned 13 victory points out of a total of 25 possible victory points, then award 2,240,000 C-bills to the first side and
3,640,000 C-bills to the second side.
</p> 
<p class='noindent'>   If the scenario has a secondary objective that each side can achieve without preventing the other side from achieving the
objective, then award this objective 3,000,000 C-bills. This payment maybe partially awarded if it is possible to achieve
different levels of success for the secondary objective. If the scenario does not have a secondary objective, then select a
secondary objective for the scenario.
</p> 
<p class='noindent'>   League organizers may make adjustments to these guidelines as desired.
   
   </p>
   <h4 class='subsectionHead' id='chaos-campaign'><span class='titlemark'>6.2   </span> <a id='x7-380006.2'></a>Chaos Campaign</h4>
 
<p class='indent'><span class='ecti-1000'>BattleTech: Chaos Campaign </span>provides campaign rules that have lower complexity than <span class='ecti-1000'>BattleTech: Campaign Operations </span>and
is available as a free PDF. The Chaos Campaign rules are used for campaigns in <span class='ecti-1000'>BattleTech: Chaos Campaign: Succession
Wars </span>as well as <span class='ecti-1000'>BattleTech: Spotlight On </span>and <span class='ecti-1000'>BattleTech: Turning Points </span>publications and <span class='ecti-1000'>Shrapnel</span>, the BattleTech
magazine. The <span class='ecti-1000'>Hot Spots: Hinterlands </span>sourcebook or the <span class='ecti-1000'>BattleTech: Mercenaries </span>box set adds a contract system for the
<span class='ecti-1000'>BattleTech: Chaos Campaign </span>system.
</p> 
<p class='noindent'>   <span class='ecti-1000'>BattleTech: Outworlds Wastes </span>can be used as the logistics system for <span class='ecti-1000'>BattleTech: Chaos Campaign </span>with the <span class='ecti-1000'>BattleTech:
Mercenaries </span>box set extension.
   
   </p>
   <h5 class='subsubsectionHead' id='contract-terms'><span class='titlemark'>6.2.1   </span> <a id='x7-390006.2.1'></a>Contract Terms</h5>
                                                                                                
                                                                                                
 
<p class='indent'>1,000 Supply Points for <span class='ecti-1000'>Mercenary Chaos Campaign </span>is worth 3,500,000 C-bills in <span class='ecti-1000'>BattleTech: Outworlds Wastes</span>. A standard
10,000 BV <span class='ecti-1000'>BattleTech: Outworlds Wastes </span>force is equivalent to a Scale 2 force in <span class='ecti-1000'>Mercenary Chaos Campaign</span>. These
conversion rules assume one scenario per month for the ease of computing logistics costs.
</p> 
<p class='noindent'>   These following contract terms in <span class='ecti-1000'>Mercenary Chaos Campaign </span>interact with <span class='ecti-1000'>BattleTech: Outworlds Wastes </span>as described
below.
   </p>
     <ul class='itemize1'>
     <li class='itemize'><span class='ecbx-1000'>Base Pay</span>: <span class='ecti-1000'>BattleTech: Outworlds Wastes </span>assumes the employer or supporting faction covers 100% of the base
     operating costs for the force. When using the <span class='ecti-1000'>Mercenary Chaos Campaign </span>system, the base operating cost for
     a <span class='ecti-1000'>BattleTech: Outworlds Wastes </span>force is 3,500,000 C-bills. If the contract provides lower than 100% Base Pay,
     the commander must pay these operating costs after each scenario. For example, if the contract has 80% Base
     Pay, the commander pays 700,000 C-bills after each scenario as basic operating costs. Similarly, if the contract
     has higher than 100% base pay, the commander earns extra C-bills after each scenario.
     </li>
     <li class='itemize'><span class='ecbx-1000'>Straight Support</span>: Reduce the <span class='ecti-1000'>repair </span>and <span class='ecti-1000'>recruit </span>costs by the percentage of Straight Support in the contract.
     For example, if the contract offers 80% Straight Support, the commander only pays 20% of the <span class='ecti-1000'>repair </span>and
<span class='ecti-1000'>replace </span>costs.
     </li>
     <li class='itemize'><span class='ecbx-1000'>Battle Support</span>: Reduce the <span class='ecti-1000'>replace </span>costs by the percentage of Battle Support in the contract. For example,
     if the contract offers 10% Battle Support, the commander only pays 90% of the <span class='ecti-1000'>replace </span>costs. Note that a
     contract with Battle Support also grants 100% Straight Support, so the commander only pays the remaining
     portion of the <span class='ecti-1000'>replace </span>costs and none of the <span class='ecti-1000'>repair </span>or <span class='ecti-1000'>recruit </span>costs.
     </li>
     <li class='itemize'><span class='ecbx-1000'>Salvage Rights</span>: Only collect the percent of the revenue from <span class='ecti-1000'>salvage </span>granted by the Salvage Rights. For
     example, if the contract offers 60% Salvage Rights, then the commander only earns 15% of the C-bill cost when
     selling salvaged units instead of the typical 25% of the C-bill cost. Also, the Salvage Rights limit how many
     units the commander may salvage and add to their force. Multiply the number of enemy units destroyed by
     the Salvage Rights percentage and round down to determine how many units may be salvaged and added to
     their force. A minimum of 1 unit can always be salvaged and added to their force. For example, if a commander
     destroys 5 enemy units and has 60% Salvage Rights, then they may add up to 3 of those units to their force.
     If a commander destroys 2 enemy units and has 40% Salvage Rights, then they may add only 1 of those units
     to their force.
     </li>
     <li class='itemize'><span class='ecbx-1000'>Command Rights</span>: The specific scenarios determine what effects, if any, Command Rights have on the
     scenario.
     </li>
     <li class='itemize'><span class='ecbx-1000'>Transportation  Terms</span>:  If  using  transportation  costs,  use  the  1,000  Supply  Points  to  3,500,000  C-bills
     conversion to compute transportation costs. The employer or supporting faction covers the negotiated portion
     of the C-bill cost. If not tracking transportation costs, then Transportation Terms must be set to 100% (step
     9).
     </li></ul>
 
<p class='noindent'>   League organizers may allow a limited set of contracts or may allow commanders to negotiate contract terms per the
rules in the <span class='ecti-1000'>BattleTech: Mercenaries </span>box set. Reputation cannot be used to modify contract terms unless
allowed by league organizers. League organizers set the frequency at which contracts may be renegotiated. If the
renegotiation occurs while the force remains on the same planet, then the Transportation Terms cannot be
renegotiated.

   <h5 class='subsubsectionHead' id='default-contracts'><span class='titlemark'>6.2.2   </span> <a id='x7-400006.2.2'></a>Default Contracts</h5>
 
<p class='indent'>Two typical contracts for <span class='ecti-1000'>BattleTech: Outworlds Wastes </span>are given here. As described in the <span class='ecti-1000'>BattleTech: Mercenaries </span>box set,
commanders may negotiate to adjust the terms of their contract.
</p> 
<p class='noindent'>   The first default contract replicates the <span class='ecti-1000'>BattleTech: Outworlds Wastes </span>system. Commanders have 100% Base Pay
(step 7), Independent Command Rights (step 11), 100% Salvage Rights (step 13), no Support Rights (step 1),
and 100% Transportation Terms (step 9). Force maintenance works as described in the <a href='force-management.html#force-maintenance-and-improvements'>Force Maintenance</a>
section.
</p> 
<p class='noindent'>   The second default contract significantly reduces the maintenance cost for commanders while also reducing salvage and
transportation payments. Commanders have 100% Base Pay (step 7), House Command Rights (step 7), 40% Salvage Rights
(step 7), 10% Battle Support Rights (step 7), and 50% Transportation Terms (step 7). Force maintenance works as described
in the <a href='force-management.html#force-maintenance-and-improvements'>Force Maintenance</a> section with the following modifications.

     added to your force to earn 10% of the unitâ€™s C-bill cost.
     </p></dd></dl>
   
   <h5 class='subsubsectionHead' id='scenario-scoring1'><span class='titlemark'>6.2.3   </span> <a id='x7-410006.2.3'></a>Scenario Scoring</h5>
 
<p class='indent'>Organizers may score scenarios by using the Supply Point payments given in the <span class='ecti-1000'>Mercenary Chaos Campaign</span>
and using the 1,000 Supply Points to 3,500,000 C-bills conversion. This scoring only provides three possible
payments for the primary objective in a scenario, 50%, 100%, or 150% of the 3,5000,000 base pay for a Scale 2
force.
</p> 
<p class='noindent'>   For a more granular scoring for any <span class='ecti-1000'>BattleTech: Chaos Campaign </span>scenario, award the 7,000,000 C-bills
payment for the primary objective proportional to the victory points or supply points earned by each side.
For example, if one side earned 8 victory points and the other side earned 13 victory points out of a total
25 possible victory points, then award 2,240,000 C-bills to the first side and 3,640,000 C-bills to the second
side.
</p> 
<p class='noindent'>   If the scenario has secondary objectives, the maximum secondary objective payment should be 3,000,000
C-bills.
</p> 
<p class='noindent'>   League organizers may make adjustments to these guidelines as desired.
