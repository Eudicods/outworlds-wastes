We welcome suggestions and contributions from new collaborators.

Before creating a Pull Request, please open a [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/Eudicods/outworlds-wastes/issues) to discuss the proposed change.
If the issue already has been created, please let us know you'd like to work on the issue by adding a comment.

Changes involving only code, such as updating the automated build process, can discussed and implemented purely online.
However, changes involving the rules need to be playtested before they are accepted.

External collaborators should use the [Fork and Pull](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/getting-started/about-collaborative-development-models#fork-and-pull-model) model when creating new contributions.

For project members, changes are automatically deployed to the [rules-pdf-staging](https://github.com/Eudicods/outworlds-wastes/tree/rules-pdf-staging) and [rules-web-staging](https://github.com/Eudicods/outworlds-wastes/tree/rules-web-staging) branches.
External contributors using Fork and Pull will should have previews of their changes deployed to their fork in the corresponding branches.
Both of these builds must pass successfully before a contribution can be merged.
LaTeX can be fiddly about formatting, so please check the generated PDFs carefully.
