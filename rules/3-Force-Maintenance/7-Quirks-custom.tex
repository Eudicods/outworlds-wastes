If commanders have opted into using \emph{Design Quirks}, they may purchase additional quirks to customize their units.
If a commander uses \emph{Custom Design Quirks}, then the additional quirks apply to the SP activity costs for all units.
Both sides must agree to use \emph{Custom Design Quirks} for them to apply in a scenario.

Pay 5\% of the unit's cost in SP per positive quirk point to add a positive quirk.
For each positive quirk, commanders must select negative quirks with a total value greater than or equal to the positive quirk's point value.
Increase the unit's SP costs by 5\% for each positive quirk point purchased.
See \emph{BattleTech: Campaign Operations} p. 255 for a table summarizing which quirks may be applied to which unit types. The following quirks may added to your units:

Positive Design Quirks:
