Each side may salvage destroyed enemy units at the end of a track, unless the Special Rules of the track prohibit salvage.
Salvaged units are not removed from the opponent's force and may still be repaired normally.
Truly Destroyed units cannot be salvaged and are removed from the opponent's force.

Compute the total SP earned from salvage by adding together the selling price of all destroyed enemy units and multiplying by the Salvage Rights percentage, and add these SP to your Warchest.
If your contract has 10\% or better Salvage Rights (step 4), you may purchase any of the destroyed enemy units salvaged from the track.
Truly Destroyed units cannot be purchased.
