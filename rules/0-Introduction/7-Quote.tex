      "\emph{BattleTech} is so engaging because it has a place for all of us.
      In the world building and fiction, absolutely, but also in the playing community and on the production side.
      It is now and always has been a product of a lot of people’s dreams that somewhere and some when out there, humanity will find a place to make its dreams and aspirations come true.
      We all have the chance to realize ourselves in \emph{BattleTech}."
