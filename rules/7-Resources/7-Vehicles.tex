The \emph{BattleTech: Total Warfare} rules for Combat Vehicles are similar to the rules for 'Mechs, with a few important differences.
Many of these differences are listed below, with page numbers from \emph{BattleTech: Total Warfare} for reference.

\begin{itemize}

  \item {\bfseries General}:

  \begin{itemize}

    \item Combat Vehicles are only 1 level high (see p. 99, \emph{TW}).

  \end{itemize}

  \item {\bfseries Movement Phase}:

  \begin{itemize}

    \item Combat Vehicles have additional prohibited terrain types (see p. 52, \emph{TW}).

    \item Ground vehicles require 2 MP to change level and may only change 1 level at a time (see p. 49, \emph{TW}).

    \item Ground vehicles receive one additional 1 MP when traveling on pavement for the entire Movement Phase (see p. 61, \emph{TW}).

    \item WiGE, VTOL, and Hover Vehicles may sideslip when turning at flank speed (running) (see p. 67, \emph{TW}).

  \end{itemize}

  \item {\bfseries Attack Phases}:

  \begin{itemize}

    \item Combat Vehicles with turrets can select the firing arc for the turret (see p. 104 \emph{TW}).

    \item Combat Vehicles have different damage hit location zones and hit location tables (see p. 192-, 196, \emph{TW}).

    \item Combat Vehicle damage may cause motive system damage which can slow or immobilize the vehicle (see p. 193, \emph{TW}).

    \item Combat Vehicle critical damage is resolved by rolling 2D6 and consulting the critical hit table for the vehicle; there is no roll for the number of critical hits (see p. 194-196, \emph{TW}).

    \item Combat Vehicles are destroyed if all internal structure in one location is destroyed or if the critical damage results in destruction (see p. 128, \emph{TW}).

  \end{itemize}

  \item Many of Combat Vehicle tables can be printed directly on the Combat Vehicle record sheet in \href{https://megamek.org}{MegaMekLab}.
        It is recommended to verify the tables printed on record sheets against \emph{BattleTech: Total Warfare} and any applicable errata.

\end{itemize}
