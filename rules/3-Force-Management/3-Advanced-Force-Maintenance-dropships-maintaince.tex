\emph{\bfseries Maintenance}: Improve the ability to repair, replace, or refit units in a maintenance category.
Also, commanders may fix a limited number of through-armor critical hits or motive system damage without paying the \emph{repair} cost.
The maintenance categories are 'Mechs, ground Combat Vehicles, VTOL Combat Vehicles, Aerospace units, and ProtoMechs.

This customization stacks with quirks.
A unit that is \emph{Easy to Maintain} on a DropShip with level 1 in maintenance for that unit type is 15\% cheaper to \emph{repair} or \emph{replace} while a unit that is \emph{Hard to Maintain} would only be 5\% more expensive to \emph{repair} or \emph{replace}.

The maintenance level cannot be adjusted for a unit type not present in the force.
For example, a force must have VTOL units to raise or lower the VTOL maintenance category.
If the last unit of a type is sold or destroyed, commanders must replace the unit with another of the type or immediately pay to reallocate any positive or negative points to reset the category to level 0.
