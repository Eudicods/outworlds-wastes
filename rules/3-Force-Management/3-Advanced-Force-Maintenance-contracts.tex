\item {\bfseries Contracts}: Negotiate the terms of your employment.
The default contract is Type A - 100\% Objective Pay and Salvage Received, but 0\% Repair Coverage.
Commanders may select a different type of contract to have more repairs covered in exchange for lower payouts from scenarios.

Reduce the \emph{repair}, \emph{replace}, and \emph{recruit} costs by the percentage given by the Repair Costs level.
Multiply the C-bills earned from objectives by the percentage given by Objective Pay level.
Multiply the C-bills earned from salvage by the percentage given by the Salvage Received level.
Also, commanders may only add a portion of the enemy units destroyed to their force, given by the total number of enemy units destroyed multiplied by the percentage given by the Salvage level, rounded up.
