You start with a budget of Battle Value (BV) or Point Value (PV) for your initial units and a Warchest of Support Points (SP).
Completing scenarios and accomplishing objectives earns additional SP for commanders to spend on maintaining their units, training their pilots, and acquiring new equipment.
You may maintain and improve your force between tracks with the Chaos Campaign rules from the \emph{BattleTech: Mercenaries} box set or \emph{BattleTech: Hinterlands} sourcebook.

If any units in your force have special equipment not found in \emph{BattleTech: Total Warfare}, \emph{BattleTech: BattleMech Manual}, or \emph{Alpha Strike: Commander's Edition}, then you must bring the rulebooks for that equipment.
Unit record sheets can be generated using \href{https://megamek.org}{MegaMekLab} or similar tools.
Alpha Strike cards can be found on the \href{http://www.masterunitlist.info}{Master Unit List}.

BV costs sometimes do not mach between the \href{http://www.masterunitlist.info}{Master Unit List} and \href{https://megamek.org}{MegaMekLab}, especially for conventional infantry units, due differences in the official rules.
You must use the same source for all BV costs and all record sheets must agree with the BV costs from this source.
