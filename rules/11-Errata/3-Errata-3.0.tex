\section{Version 3.0}

This errata applies to version 3.0 of the BattleTech: Outworlds Wastes rules.

\subsection{Advanced Force Maintenance and Improvements}

\subsubsection{Omni Repair}

Add the following new optional rule.

\begin{description}

\item {\bfseries Omni Repair}: Calculate the \emph{repair} costs without the Omni Conversion Cost.
OmniMechs and OmniVehicles cost 125\% of the base cost of the materials to construct due to their complexity.
Commanders may reduce their \emph{repair} costs for Omni units by 20\%.
For example, a Timber Wolf Prime would cost 4,846,625 C-bills to \emph{repair} instead of 6,058,281 C-bills.
If Granular Repair is in effect, then apply this adjustment to the the cost per internal section or structure bubble.
This modification does not apply to the cost \emph{replace} the unit when destroyed.

\end{description}
