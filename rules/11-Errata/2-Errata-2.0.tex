\section{Version 2.0}

This errata applies to version 2.0 of the BattleTech: Outworlds Wastes rules.

\subsection{Force Maintenance and Improvements}

Update the \emph{repair} rule to make motive system damage free to repair.

\begin{description}

\item {\bfseries Repair}: Pay 25\% of the C-bill cost, rounded up, to repair all internal damage and critical components for a unit that has not been \emph{destroyed}.
If the pilot/crew was killed, the repair cost includes a 5/6 pilot or crew that may be \emph{trained}.
Armor and motive systems are repaired for free.
For Omni units, the repair cost is based upon the fielded variant.

\end{description}

\subsection{Advanced Force Maintenance and Improvements}

\subsubsection{Dropship Customization}

Double the percentage benefits and detriments for all improvement levels.
For example, Level 1 of Machine Shop now grants a 10\% decrease in salvage costs instead of a 5\% decrease.
