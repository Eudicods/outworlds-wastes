\subsubsection{The Youngbloods - Succession Wars Renaissance Era Mercenary Force}

The world of Sterope is one of the jewels of the Taurian Concordat.
With the Taurian military spread thin, the nobility of the world took it upon themselves to create their own defense force; the Noble’s Regiment.
In an attempt to expand the Regiment, the nobility funded a small mechwarrior training academy on the world.

Unfortunately, this brought the attention of a large pirate band which came to raid the campus for parts and munitions.
Determined to defend their students, the handful of grizzled TDF veterans serving as instructors mounted up.
As they moved to head off the invaders, they ordered the students to evacuate to shelters.

Those students, however, were determined Taurians.
Hearing that the instructors were in a desperate fight, they rushed to the hangers and mounted up in every piece of equipment that moved to join the fray.
Ultimately, the pirates were forced to retreat but only after the last of the instructors and half the cadets had been killed.

In the aftermath of the fight, the local populace considered the cadets to be heroes.
They had acted in the finest tradition of the Noble’s Regiment and faced a threat to the world.

However, they had also disobeyed orders.
Millions of C-bills worth of academy property were destroyed.
Lawyers argued that the actions of the students forced the instructors to sacrifice themselves to protect them.
Regardless of the support of the civilian population, the cadets were found guilty of a myriad of crimes and expelled from the academy and the armed forces.

The majority of the cadets, infuriated at this response to their actions, decided they would take their chances as mercenaries rather than stay on Sterope.
They plotted to steal the equipment they had used to defend the academy.
After securing a DropShip through the good graces of people of the world, the cadets snuck into the equipment hanger.

They were shocked to discover not a single sentry guarding the hanger and none of the equipment was properly locked down. Even the hanger doors had been left unlocked.
The staff of the academy could not officially support their students... but they could make sure there was no resistance to their plan...
