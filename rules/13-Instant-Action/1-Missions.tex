In order to use \emph{BattleTech: Instant Action} missions as casual scenarios for \emph{BattleTech: Outworlds Wastes}, first each side agrees upon a BV limit.
The standard \emph{BattleTech: Outworlds Wastes} limits of 6,000 BV for 1v1 or 10,000 BV for 2v2 agree with the recommendations for \emph{BatleTech: Instant Action}.

Next, both sides agree upon a Battlefield Support Points (BSP) budget and if Gambits and Conditions are being used.
BSP can be used with or without Gambits and Conditions, and Gambits and Conditions may be used with no other BSP, such as BSP Strikes.

Then, each side selects an agenda and consults the Mission Matrix to determine which mission corresponds to this pair of agendas.
Any special rules for the selected mission given in the Game Concepts section apply.
The mission determines the primary objective.

Finally, each side selects a secondary objective per the instructions in Secondary Objectives subsection of the Scenarios section for \emph{BattleTech: Outworlds Wastes}.

The secondary objective is scored as described in the Secondary Objectives subsection of \emph{BattleTech: Outworlds Wastes}.
The primary objective is scored as described below.

\begin{description}

\item {\bfseries Circle of Equals}: Each side receives a proportion of 7,000,000 C-bills based upon the ratio of the percentage of enemy BV \emph{destroyed} by each side.
Units that withdraw do not count as \emph{destroyed} for the purposes of scoring.
Award an extra 15\% to the side who had the last active units on the field during the End Phase, if any.
For example, if the first side \emph{destroyed} 30\% of the enemy BV and the second side \emph{destroyed} 35\% of the enemy BV and had the only active units on the field during the final End Phase, then the second side is considered to have destroyed 50\% of the enemy BV.
The first side receives 37.5\% of the C-bills and the second side receives 62.5\% of the C-bills.
The first side receives 2,625,000 C-bills and the second side receives 4,375,000 C-bills.

\item {\bfseries Ambush}: Each side receives a proportion of 7,000,000 C-bills based upon the percentage of the Confront side's non-infantry units \emph{destroyed} or withdrawing.
If the Hold side receives double the percentage of the Confront side's non-infantry units that are \emph{destroyed} or withdrawing, up to 100\%.
For example, if 28\% of the Confront side's non-infantry units are \emph{destroyed} or withdrawing, then the Hold side receives 56\% of the C-bills, or 3,920,000 C-bills, and the Confront side receives the remaining 44\% of the C-bills, or 3,080,000 C-bills.

\item {\bfseries Scanner Drop}: Each side receives a proportion of 7,000,000 C-bills based upon the percentage of target hexes with beacons placed.
For example, if the Recon side placed 4 beacons, then the Recon side receives 4,666,667 C-bills and the Confront side receives the remaining 2,333,333 C-bills.

\item {\bfseries Death before Dishonor}: Each side receives a portion of 7,000,000 C-bills based upon the status of the objective.

Otherwise, each side receives 3,500,000 C-bills.

\item {\bfseries Take Intact}: Each side receives a proportion of 7,000,000 C-bills based upon the percentage of the Confront units except for the Prize that have suffered crippling damage.
Units that withdraw count as crippled for the purposes of scoring.

If 3 of the 5 non-Prize units suffered crippling damage, then the Salvage side receives 4,200,000 C-bills and the Confront side receives 2,800,000 C-bills.
If the Prize did not suffer crippling damage and all of the other Confront units suffered crippling damage, then the Salvage side may forgo all other \emph{salvage} to instead \emph{salvage} the Prize and add it to their list, paying only 30\% of the C-bill cost.
