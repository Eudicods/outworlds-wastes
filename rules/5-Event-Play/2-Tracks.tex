Event organizers provide tracks, which may be either player-vs-GM or player-vs-player.
Commanders may use different units for different tracks in a contract.

The standard rules given in the \emph{BattleTech: Mercenaries} box set and the \emph{Hot Spots: Hinterlands} sourcebook apply to these tracks, unless the organizers modify these rules.

Commanders may bring up to 3,000 BV (100 PV) of 'Mechs to each track, excluding the cost of Skill Advances but including any costs of C\textsuperscript{3} and TAG.
Commanders may bring 500 BV (25 PV) non-'Mech units, plus any unspent BV (PV) from 'Mech units, for a total of 3,500 BV (125 PV).

If allowed by event organizers, commanders may convert up to 500 BV to 25 BSP and run the non-'Mech units as Battlefield Support: Assets; however, Assets may not score objectives.

If allowed by event organizers, commanders get 7 BSP for Battlefield Support: Strikes.
Any unspent BV or BSP may be converted to BSP to use for Battlefield Support: Strikes, unless prohibited by the track rules.
