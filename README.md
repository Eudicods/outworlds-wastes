BattleTech: Outworlds Wastes provides a lightweight framework for narrative BattleTech leagues and events with simplified campaign logistics rules.

Completing objectives in scenarios earns C-bills that commanders use to maintain and upgrade their forces.
Commanders play scenarios in multiple formats, such as [BattleTech][battletech-tw] and [Alpha Strike][battletech-as].
