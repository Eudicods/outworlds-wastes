<p class='noindent'>   <span class='ecti-1000'>BattleTech: Instant Action </span>is a supplement that is intended to add depth and variety to pickup games. <span class='ecti-1000'>BattleTech: Instant
Action </span>missions can be used to expand the number of casual scenarios available for <span class='ecti-1000'>BattleTech: Outworlds
Wastes</span>. This guide is for <span class='ecti-1000'>BattleTech: Outworlds Wastes </span>version 3.1 and <span class='ecti-1000'>BattleTech: Instant Action </span>version

   <h4 class='subsectionHead' id='mission-scoring'><span class='titlemark'>7.1   </span> <a id='x8-460007.1'></a>Mission Scoring</h4>
 
<p class='indent'>In order to use <span class='ecti-1000'>BattleTech: Instant Action </span>missions as casual scenarios for <span class='ecti-1000'>BattleTech: Outworlds Wastes</span>, first each side
agrees upon a BV limit. The standard <span class='ecti-1000'>BattleTech: Outworlds Wastes </span>limits of 6,000 BV for 1v1 or 10,000 BV for 2v2 agree
with the recommendations for <span class='ecti-1000'>BatleTech: Instant Action</span>.
</p> 
<p class='noindent'>   Next, both sides agree upon a Battlefield Support Points (BSP) budget and if Gambits and Conditions are being used.
BSP can be used with or without Gambits and Conditions, and Gambits and Conditions may be used with no other BSP,
such as BSP Strikes.
</p> 
<p class='noindent'>   Then, each side selects an agenda and consults the Mission Matrix to determine which mission corresponds to this pair of
agendas. Any special rules for the selected mission given in the Game Concepts section apply. The mission determines the
primary objective.
</p> 
<p class='noindent'>   Finally, each side selects a secondary objective per the instructions in Secondary Objectives subsection of the Scenarios
section for <span class='ecti-1000'>BattleTech: Outworlds Wastes</span>.
</p> 
<p class='noindent'>   The secondary objective is scored as described in the Secondary Objectives subsection of <span class='ecti-1000'>BattleTech: Outworlds Wastes</span>.
The primary objective is scored as described below.

     The side that has the last active units on the field during an End Phase, if any, receives an additional 2,000,000
     C-bills. For example, if the first side <span class='ecti-1000'>destroyed </span>30% of the enemy BV and the second side <span class='ecti-1000'>destroyed </span>35% of the
     enemy BV, then the first side receives 46.2% of the C-bills and the second side receives 53.8% of the C-bills.
