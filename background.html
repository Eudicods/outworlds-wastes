<p class='noindent'>   The Outworlds Alliance was founded in 2413 and largely enjoyed prosperity throughout the Star League Era. At the start
of the Amaris Civil War in 2766, the Outworlds Alliance contained 135 major systems organized into 7 administrative
districts. The Succession Wars that followed the fall of the Star League in 2780 were particularly difficult for the
Outworlds Alliance, and they had to abandon systems that they no longer had the resources or infrastructure
to support. By the end of the Third Succession War in 3025, the Outworlds Alliance only had 36 systems
remaining.
</p> 
<p class='noindent'>   Clan Snow Raven began exploring the Periphery soon after the end of Operation REVIVAL in 3052. The
Outworlds Alliance and Clan Snow Raven encountered each other and began developing mutual respect and a
tentative alliance in 3064. Clan Snow Raven took refuge in the Outworlds Alliance following their abjuration
from the Clan Homeworlds after the Wars of Reaving in 3075. In 3083, Clan Snow Raven and the Outworlds
Alliance merged to form the Raven Alliance. By the ilClan Trial in 3151, the Raven Alliance contained 47
systems.
</p> 
<p class='noindent'>   Most of these lost worlds form a region known as the Outworlds Wastes. The exact number of lost systems varies from era
to era, but the Outworlds Alliance has abandoned approximately 90 systems. Many factions are eager to explore these
systems in search of lost Star League technology or to take refuge from the political machinations of the Inner Sphere
successor states.
</p> 
<p class='noindent'>   You command a combined arms force exploring the Outworlds Wastes for your faction. Commanders compete with other
factions in the Outworlds Wastes to grow their force and recover lost technology. Common factions for the region are given
below.
   </p>
     <ul class='itemize1'>
     <li class='itemize'><span class='ecbx-1000'>Outworlds Alliance</span>: A resourceful faction focused on reclaiming lost resources to support their remaining
     systems who was founded by frontier settlers and isolationists.
     </li>
     <li class='itemize'><span class='ecbx-1000'>Clan Snow Raven</span>: An opportunistic and efficient clan, recently arrived from the Homeworlds, that is seeking
     to eek out an existence in the abandoned worlds of the Outworlds Alliance.
     </li>

     knightly orders and chivalry.
     </li>
     <li class='itemize'><span class='ecbx-1000'>Mercenary  groups</span>:  Flexible  and  opportunistic  forces  driven  by  profit,  holding  shifting  allegiances,  and
     inspired by historical mercenaries and free companies.
                                                                                                
                                                                                                
     </li>
     <li class='itemize'><span class='ecbx-1000'>Pirate gangs</span>: Outlaws motivated by greed, power, and the freedom from any government oversight living
     under the code of might is right.
     </li>
     <li class='itemize'><span class='ecbx-1000'>Clan Dark Caste</span>: Clan bandits, renegades, and malcontents doing what they must to survive while utilizing
     stolen or scavenged Clan equipment.
     </li></ul>
 
<p class='noindent'>   These factions are the most prevalent in the region, but many other factions may be found in the Outworlds Wastes.
Commanders may pick the faction any find interesting.
</p> 
<p class='noindent'>   League organizers pick the current era for the league; organizers can select any era after the fall of the Star
League. The era determines unit availability and the most common factions present in the Outworlds Wastes.
The Outworlds Wastes offers a lot of narrative options; however league organizers can pick any location that
is appropriate for their league. Commanders should ask the organizers which era and region their league is
in.
                                                                                                
                                                                                                
</p> 
<p class='noindent'>   The general background, goals, and playstyles of the common factions in the Outworlds Wastes are outlined below.
Commanders may use these descriptions as inspiration for their forces but are not limited to the notes given
here.
</p> 
<p class='noindent'>   <span class='ecbx-1000'>Outworlds Alliance</span>: The Outworlds Alliance has always prioritized survival over expansion, especially during and after
the devastating Succession Wars. They now focus on reclaiming lost resources to support their struggling systems.
Commanders from the Alliance are tasked with recovering critical supplies and technology to bolster their defense against
external threats and internal collapse. Known for their pacifist roots, they often prefer defensive tactics and only striking
when absolutely necessary.
</p> 
<p class='noindent'>   <span class='ecti-1000'>Playstyle</span>: Focus on logistics, careful planning, and defensive positions rather than direct engagement. Ideal for
commanders who enjoy longer-term strategies and avoiding unnecessary risks.
</p> 
<p class='noindent'>   <span class='ecbx-1000'>Clan Snow Raven</span>: Clan Snow Raven is driven by a desire to rebuild after its abjuration from the Clan Homeworlds and
sees the Outworlds Wastes as a prime opportunity. They focus on claiming new systems to expand their influence and gather
valuable Star League technology. Snow Raven commanders are highly disciplined and use air and space superiority to
outmaneuver opponents, prioritizing the acquisition of territory and technology to fuel their efforts to solidify their
position.
</p> 
<p class='noindent'>   <span class='ecti-1000'>Playstyle</span>: High-tech and strategic, emphasizing mobility, air and space superiority, and tech acquisition. Perfect for
commanders who enjoy a blend of aggressive expansion and tactical flexibility.
</p> 
<p class='noindent'>   <span class='ecbx-1000'>Draconis Combine</span>: Steeped in a warrior code inspired by samurai traditions, the Draconis Combine is driven by a
fierce sense of honor. In the Outworlds Wastes, their mission is simple: conquer and claim LosTech to bolster their military
strength. Combine commanders prioritize direct confrontation and see each battle as an opportunity to prove their worth.
They view the Wastes as a battleground to extend their reach and crush opposition, especially from rival factions like the
Federated Suns.
</p> 
<p class='noindent'>   <span class='ecti-1000'>Playstyle</span>: Aggressive and honor-bound, favoring heavily armed forces and head-on confrontations. Best for commanders
who enjoy straightforward combat and maintaining a strong offensive presence.
</p> 
<p class='noindent'>   <span class='ecbx-1000'>Federated Suns</span>: The Federated Suns, driven by their knightly traditions, see the Outworlds Wastes as an opportunity
to bolster their interests. Their primary goals are to secure vital resources and prevent hostile factions, like the Draconis
Combine, from gaining a foothold. Suns commanders are pragmatic, blending diplomacy with force and willing to negotiate
to secure strategic advantages. In the Wastes, they’re known for their adaptability and readiness to seize opportunities to
strengthen their position.
</p> 
<p class='noindent'>   <span class='ecti-1000'>Playstyle</span>: Balanced and tactical with the flexibility to switch between diplomacy and military action. Ideal for
commanders who enjoy a mix of negotiation and combat while focusing on securing objectives.
</p> 
<p class='noindent'>   <span class='ecbx-1000'>Mercenary Groups</span>: Mercenaries are drawn to the Outworlds Wastes for one reason: profit. These opportunistic groups
are willing to work for the highest bidder and constantly shifting allegiances based on who offers the most C-bills. Mercenary
commanders are flexible and resourceful, using whatever means necessary to achieve their goals. Whether hired to scout for
LosTech or protect corporate interests, mercenaries thrive in the chaos of the Wastes, adapting quickly to ever-changing
circumstances.
</p> 
<p class='noindent'>   <span class='ecti-1000'>Playstyle</span>: Flexible and opportunistic, capable of switching tactics and allegiances on the fly. Ideal for commanders who
enjoy a wide range of strategies and unpredictable engagements.
</p> 
<p class='noindent'>   <span class='ecbx-1000'>Pirate Gangs</span>: The lawless regions of the Outworlds Wastes are a haven for pirate gangs. These ruthless raiders strike
quickly and without warning, plundering resources and tech from vulnerable forces. Pirates prefer hit-and-run tactics,
avoiding drawn-out battles in favor of rapid strikes that leave their enemies reeling. They operate on the fringes, exploiting
the lack of central authority and preying on isolated outposts. In the Wastes, pirate commanders thrive on chaos and the
spoils of war.
</p> 
<p class='noindent'>   <span class='ecti-1000'>Playstyle</span>: Fast and unpredictable, focusing on hit-and-run tactics and opportunistic strikes. Best for commanders who
prefer guerrilla warfare and ambushing unsuspecting opponents.
</p> 
<p class='noindent'>   <span class='ecbx-1000'>Clan Dark Caste</span>: Outcasts from the rigid Clan structure, the Dark Caste is made up of warriors who have been
shunned by their brethren. Now, they survive on the fringes of Clan society, scavenging for resources and using
unconventional tactics to stay one step ahead of both Clans and Inner Sphere forces. In the Outworlds Wastes, Dark Caste
commanders are desperate, using guerrilla warfare and sabotage to maintain their independence and scrape together the
resources they need to survive.
</p> 
<p class='noindent'>   <span class='ecti-1000'>Playstyle</span>: Desperate and unconventional, relying on sabotage, guerrilla tactics, and scavenging. Perfect for commanders
who enjoy asymmetric warfare and surviving against the odds.
