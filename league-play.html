<p class='noindent'>   There are two types of league play, narrative and competitive. Establishing a balanced competitive league is difficult.
These rules do not attempt to do so; instead, they provide a consistent and fair system with an option for scoring and
ranking if the players and league organizers want to use it.
   
   </p>
   <h4 class='subsectionHead' id='narrative-play'><span class='titlemark'>8.1   </span> <a id='x9-480008.1'></a>Narrative Play</h4>
 
<p class='indent'>In narrative play, commanders play narrative scenarios designed by league organizers and casual scenarios between forces.
This is an open ended format that lasts as long as commanders want to play.
</p> 
<p class='noindent'>   At any point, a new commander can join the league or a current commander can replace their force with a new one. Any
new force must follow the Force Construction rules. A commander may run multiple forces so long as the logistics and
finances of each force remain separate.
</p> 
<p class='noindent'>   Any optional or advanced rules should be agreed upon per scenario or for the entire league. For example, league
organizers could ban the <span class='ecti-1000'>Fire For Effect </span>optional rule for all league games. Advanced Force Maintenance and Improvement
rules should be consistent across the league; for example, <span class='ecti-1000'>Advanced Refit </span>needs to be available to all forces or banned from all
forces. Each side should agree upon any available optional or advanced rules for each scenario they play, such as <span class='ecti-1000'>Multiple
Attack Rolls </span>or <span class='ecti-1000'>Special Pilot Abilities</span>.
</p> 
<p class='noindent'>   After each scenario, the players repair and update their forces per the Force Maintenance and Improvements rules.
Commanders should keep track of the outcomes of all scenarios and changes to their force, as shown on the sample <a href='sample-tracking.html#force-roster'>force
roster</a> and <a href='sample-tracking.html#logistics-tracking'>scenario logistics tracker</a>.
</p> 
<p class='noindent'>   The league organizers may advance the era for the league. Commanders would then need to use the Changing Eras rules
for their force.
</p> 
<p class='noindent'>   Additional restrictions may be enforced by league organizers, such as league play only occurring at a specific location, but
any such restrictions must be announced in advance.
   
   </p>
   <h4 class='subsectionHead' id='competitive-play'><span class='titlemark'>8.2   </span> <a id='x9-490008.2'></a>Competitive Play</h4>
 
<p class='indent'>In competitive play, commanders play a series of scenarios in a Swiss-system tournament.
</p> 
<p class='noindent'>   A commander can only use a single force for the tournament. League organizers may require new forces for the
tournament or allow forces that have been used in narrative play.
</p> 
<p class='noindent'>   Any optional or advanced rules must be agreed upon in advance and consistent across the tournament play. For example,
league organizers could permit <span class='ecti-1000'>Advanced Refit </span>rules while disallowing <span class='ecti-1000'>Design Quirks </span>and <span class='ecti-1000'>Special Pilot Abilities </span>for the
tournament.
</p> 
<p class='noindent'>   The scenarios in the tournament should only be 1v1. Each commander should play a different opponent during each
scenario, if possible. The last scenario should be a large scale event that requires a significant portion of each commanderâ€™s
forces.
                                                                                                
                                                                                                
</p> 
<p class='noindent'>   Commanders may only use C-bills earned during the tournament to repair and update their forces per the Force
Maintenance and Improvements rules after a scenario. League organizers may give forces an initial maintenance
budget.
</p> 
<p class='noindent'>   Each 1,000,000 C-bills earned during a scenario is worth 1 point of <span class='ecti-1000'>fame </span>for scoring. The C-bills earned includes primary
and secondary objectives. The players rankings are updated after each scenario. Ties are broken by the lowest total <span class='ecti-1000'>repair</span>
and <span class='ecti-1000'>replacement </span>costs across all scenarios thus far.
</p> 
<p class='noindent'>   At the end of the series of scenarios, winners are determined by their ranking. Additional winners may be determined for
specific categories, such as Best Painted Force or Best Force Lore.
</p> 
<p class='noindent'>
